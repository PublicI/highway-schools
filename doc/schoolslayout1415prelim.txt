The file contains data for the school year 2014–15 sorted by the NCES assigned school identification code (NCESSCH). Data
presented in this release are available in two formats—SAS datasets (.sas7bdat) and tab-separated values text files (.txt).

In the column "Data Type" below, “AN” and “N” indicate alphanumeric and numeric data, respectively.

Note that starting with the 2002–03 CCD, all numeric fields contain a -1 to indicate missing and a -2 to indicate not applicable.
Previously, numeric fields contained an “M” to indicate missing and an “N” to indicate not applicable.  Character fields continue
to use “M” for missing and “N” for not applicable. “AN” and “N” are alphanumeric and numeric data, respectively.  Starting with 
the 2009-10 2a file, the numeric fields were tested against NCES data quality standards; a -9 value indicates that the data item 
did not meet those standards.
